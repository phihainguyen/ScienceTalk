# ScienceTalk

ScienceTalk was created using Express.js, Express-Handlebars, CSS, MongoDB, Cheerios, and Axios . In this web app cheerios was used to test scraping a science webpage which allows this web app to get science article through scraping data from a specific website, and the information obtained from that website will then be stored inside a Mongo database.

The Scraped articles will be displayed in the UI as a list of newly scraped. Each article will display it's title and it will also display the link leading to the article.

Users will have an option of storing an article to what they want to read by clicking on the add button.
